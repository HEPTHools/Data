* [Compare20x20Reps.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/Compare20x20Reps.nb) is the master notebook used to compare data from the three .m files

* [dWvH.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/dWvH.m) and [dWvHprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/dWvHprime.m)  for the de Wit-van Holten formulation (dWvH) of matter gravitino 

* [OS.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OS.m) and [OSprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OSprime.m) for the Ogievetsky-Sokatchev (OS) formulation of matter gravitino

You may need to delete a .txt from the end of [Compare20x20Reps.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/Compare20x20Reps.nb)  (.nb file should end with .nb for Mathematica to be able to use it) after downloading it. The notebook is the main file to use, it requires the [Adinkra.m](https://hepthools.github.io/Adinkra/) package and the data files [dWvH.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/dWvH.m), [OS.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OS.m), [nmSG.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/nmSG.m), [dWvHprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/dWvHprime.m), [OSprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OSprime.m), and [nmSGprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/nmSGprime.m) listed above. All .m files must be downloaded to the same directory as the .nb file for it to run properly.

This paper takes the 4D, N=2 Tensor multiplet and the 4D, N=2 Vector multiplet and from them creates a GL(2,R) x GL(2,R) 4D, N=4 Tensor-Vector multiplet.


* [4D N = 4 CV No Closure.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/1812.04236/4D%20N%20%3D%204%20CV%20No%20Closure.nb) and [4D N = 4 TV No Closure.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/1812.04236/4D%20N%20%3D%204%20TV%20No%20Closure.nb) demonstrate that there must be central charges in both merging an N=2 Vector multiplet with an N=2 Hypermultiplet and an N=2 Vector multiplet with an N=2 Tensor Multiplet, respectively.

* [4D N=4 CV Specific GL2R Central Charges.nb]() and [4D N=4 TV Specific GL2R Central Charges.nb]() calculates the central charges for the multiplets specified in the file names. [4D N=4 TV Specific GL2R Central Charges.nb]() requires the data file [] which is generated from [4D N = 4 TV No Closure.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/1812.04236/4D%20N%20%3D%204%20TV%20No%20Closure.nb).
