This paper reports the Height Yielding Matrix Numbers (HYMNs)for all GR(2,2) adinkras and all GR(4,4) adinkras. Right click or command click to download the raw files below. The [Adinkra.m](https://hepthools.github.io/Adinkra/) package is required.


* [HYMNS.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/HYMNs/HYMNS.nb) a notebook that confirms the HYMNs for GR(2,2) and randomly confirms the HYMNs for GR(4,4).

After downloading the .nb file, you may need to delete a .txt extension. All .m files must be in the same directory as the .nb file for it to run properly.
