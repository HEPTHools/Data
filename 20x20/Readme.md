This paper investigated the 4D, N=1 matter gravitino and non-minimal supergravity multiplets, each with 20 boson x 20 fermion degrees of freedom. Right click or command click to download the raw files below. The .nb file requires the [Adinkra.m](https://hepthools.github.io/Adinkra/) package.


* [Compare20x20Reps.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/Compare20x20Reps.nb) is the master notebook used to compare data from the six .m files below.

* [OS.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OS.m) and [OSprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/OSprime.m) for the Ogievetsky-Sokatchev (OS) formulation of matter gravitino

* [nmSG.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/nmSG.m) and [nmSGprime.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/20x20/nmSGprime.m) for the non-minimal supergravity (nmSG) formulation

After downloading the .nb file, you may need to delete a .txt extension. All .m files must be in the same directory as the .nb file for it to run properly.
