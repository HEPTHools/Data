This paper takes the 4D, N=2 Tensor multiplet and the 4D, N=2 Vector multiplet and from them creates a GL(2,R) x GL(2,R) 4D, N=4 Tensor-Vector multiplet. Right click or command click to download the raw files below. The .nb files require the [Adinkra.m](https://hepthools.github.io/Adinkra/) package.


* [4D N = 4 CV No Closure.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/1812.04236/4D%20N%20%3D%204%20CV%20No%20Closure.nb) demonstrates that there must be central charges in fusing the 4D, N=2 vector multiplet and 4D, N=2 hypermultiplet into a 4D, N=4 vector multiplet.

* [4D N = 4 TV No Closure.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEPTHools/Data/master/1812.04236/4D%20N%20%3D%204%20TV%20No%20Closure.nb) demonstrates that there must be central charges in fusing the 4D, N=2 vector multiplet and 4D, N=2 tensor multiplet into a 4D, N=4 vector-tensor multiplet.
